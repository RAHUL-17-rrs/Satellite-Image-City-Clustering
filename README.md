In modern urban planning, the efficient design of road networks is crucial for fostering
connectivity and sustainable development. Night-time satellite imagery offers a unique
perspective, with illuminated areas often indicative of urban centers. In this task, I have
developed an algorithm to extract the cities from this satellite image.
I have used the algorithm K nearest neighbors to find the centroid of the clusters
I also used the elbow point method to find the optimal no. of clusters
I finally plotted all the data in the image and the graph.
